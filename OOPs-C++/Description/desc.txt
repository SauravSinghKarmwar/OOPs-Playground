Object Oriented Programming :
    - More focus on data.
    - Bind the data to the function.
    - Program is divided into Objects, each objects have some data and some functions.
    - It protects data from accidental changes.

Class:
    - Fundamental unit of OOP.
    - It is an user defined datatypes.
    - Define some data/Properties & methods/functions.

Objects:
    - Objs are variables of type class.

Constructor:
    - It is used to initialized an obj.
    - It is a fun which is called when a obj is created.
    - It has same name as Class name.
    - Types:
        - Default constructor: no args passed
        - Parameterised constructor: args passed
        - Copy constructor: Initialize an obj by another existing obj

Desturctor:
    - It is a fun which is called when an obj is deleted.
    - Cannot pass any parameter in it.
    - name: ~(class_name).

Encapsulation:
    -
